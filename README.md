# FlashCards 

### Abstract:
I built an application that allows users to play a educational flashcard game in the terminal. The user will be able to interact with the program to see questions, take guesses, and receive a final score at the end of the round. The aim is to create a user-friendly and engaging interface that encourages learning and improves retention.
